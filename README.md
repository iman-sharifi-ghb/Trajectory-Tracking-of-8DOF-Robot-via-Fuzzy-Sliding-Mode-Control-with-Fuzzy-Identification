# Trajectory-Tracking-of-8DOF-Tiltrotor-via-Fuzzy-Sliding-Mode-Control-with-Fuzzy-Identification

In this project, we aim to develop a Fuzzy Sliding Mode Controller to control a Tiltrotor with 8 Degrees of Freedom. We assume that we don't have a dynamical model of the system at hand, resulting in the identification of the system using Fuzzy systems. As the system is underactuated, we need PD controllers to track an arbitrary trajectory in a decent manner. We experimented our method in differnet scenarios and have shown that our method is able to get rid of the ominous chattering problem in the system as compared to only Sliding Mode Control method.
